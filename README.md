# Systolic-Matrix-Multiplier
Built off the 8x8 matrix multiplier made in EEC 180 (check the EEC 180 repo for lab 6).

Yeah after looking at the matrix multiplier made in EEC 180, hell no I'm not using it. We made it do the actual matrix multiplication in the testbench by instantiating a bunch of multiply accumulate units. How in the world did this thing work. I'm gonna start over lmao.
